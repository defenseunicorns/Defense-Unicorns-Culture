## About Defense Unicorns
Defense Unicorns exists to develop elegant and simple to use products, that enable mission heroes to stream software delivery so they can focus on the most important challenges.

- **We believe that people matter. Our mission heroes who sacrifice so much to make the world a better place and our Unicorns, who make the amazing products that fundamentally change the world**

- **We believe that people and culture is the foundation upon which all processes and products are built**

>“Invest in people so they can work anywhere. Treat them in a way where they won’t want to work anywhere but here”

## Our Vision

A FREE AND SECURE WORLD that enables progress and innovation.

## Our Mission

Streamlining software delivery so you can focus on the most important challenges.

# Our Values

Values are only as good as your daily habits. Values not lived, are not values at all. We allow any Unicorn to propose new values. We then adopt the values that we not only believe in, but that are reflected in daily habits.  When new values are proposed, they start off as Sandbox Values.  After 70% of the company adopts daily habits around a sandbox value, it is then promoted as an Incubating Values. Following 80% contribution over 6 months, a company value can be promoted to Graduated Values.  At any point, a Graduated or Incubating Values can be demoted or removed.

### Mission Impact

*Champions: [Jesse Arlington](https://github.com/Jesse-Arlington), [Mike Vanhemert](https://github.com/mikevanhemert)*

Defense Unicorns exists to serve the mission. Mission Impact is at the core of everything we do.

**Meaning**

Mission Impact is bigger than Defense Unicorns. It is every activity that contributes to increased decision timelines and improved battlespace awareness through faster software delivery that is cheaper to sustain. Mission Impact factors into every decision we make: Who do we partner with? Where should I focus my attention today? What one area can I improve to amplify my contributions? Our Mission Heroes - not the government PM or contracting officer, not the Chief Engineer at the Program Office, but the Sailor, Soldier, Airman, Marine, and Guardian whose mission success is tied directly to the systems we advance - are our North Star.

**Engagement**

| Frequency | Style | Details |
|---|---|---| 
| Daily | Emoji | Identify Unicorns and activities delivering Mission Impact for our Heroes
| Weekly | Meme/Blog | 2-8 sentence post/meme advancing the Mission Impact value |
| Monthly | Podcast | Recorded discussion summarizing this month |

*Emoji*

The value champions will select an emoji that embodies **Mission Impact** and begin socializing its purpose across Defense Unicorns. The emoji allows us to recognize individuals and activities that directly and indirectly deliver **Mission Impact** for heroes.

We will engage the Slack API to automatically assess emoji use and periodically collate value engagement data.

*Meme/Blog*

The value champions will generate 2-4 months of ideas for memes and blog posts and post them to the [general](https://defense-unicorns.slack.com/archives/C01GAJ9LCAW) channel in Slack. Initial brainstorming ideas include:

* Develop a story arc that allows us to educate the blessing on ways to be mindful of Mission Impact in everything we do
* Relate **Mission Impact** to the [Three Ways](https://itrevolution.com/the-three-ways-principles-underpinning-devops/) and [Five Ideals](https://itrevolution.com/five-ideals-of-devops/) of DevOps codified by Gene Kim and popularized in his seminal works, *The Phoenix Project* and *The Unicorn Project*.
* Recognize noteworthy **Mission Impact** moments or events
* Generate topical and funny memes based on happenings around the blessing to propel **Mission Impact** to the forefront of every Unicorn's mind

*Podcast*

In lieu of a scheduled happy hour or waffle sesh, we will record a 10-20 minute video every month highlighting remarkable **Mission Impact** moments and champions, reflect on why **Mission Impact** is a core Defense Unicorns value, and inspire the audience with a though-provoking monologue only Jesse Arlington is capable of delivering.

The recording will posted to the [general](https://defense-unicorns.slack.com/archives/C01GAJ9LCAW) channel and a to-be-created **Mission Impact** channel (for posterity) for asynchronous viewing by unicorns in the blessing.

### Fun

*Champions: [Madeline Fortner Blanchard](https://github.com/Madeline-UX)*

People are at their best when they are having a good time.  By making fun a core part of our values, we allow ourselves to have a good time, at the same time that we are helping to change the world. 

### The Open Source Way

*Champions: [Brandt Keller](https://github.com/brandtkeller) & [Jon Perry](https://github.com/YrrepNoj) & [Gabe Scarberry](https://github.com/ntwkninja) & [Wayne Starr](https://github.com/Racer159)*

The Open Source way is a mindset for Software, Processes, and Data that we can share between one-another and externally for the intention of furthering the progress of *A free and secure world that enables progress and innovation* (see vision). 

**Meaning**

Progress and Innovation are spaces that any member of Defense Unicorns can strive towards. It is also a space where we can contribute to the betterment of society through knowledge sharing and teaching others. These others may often be other Unicorns who are broadening their horizions to new technologies or workflows. It may also be external, and the free sharing of processes, information, data and code for the purpose of building a more free and secure tomorrow. We share processes in such a way that enable members to provide contributions directly and asynchronously - rather than through a specified focal and/or non-documented synchronous engagements. It also means that we advocate and encourage any member of the company to review and participate in current established products/processes and enable them to contribute through any iteration that makes the product/process better than it was originally.

## Incubating Values

### Experimentation

*Champions: [Andrew Blanchard](https://github.com/blancharda) & [Austin Abro](https://github.com/AustinAbro321)*

Proposed Habit: clearly identify the experiments you are running, how you are going to run them, for how long you are going to run them, and what the success or failure outcomes are.

### Ownership

*Champions: [Austen Bryan](https://github.com/austenbryan) & [Brian Rexrode](https://github.com/brianrexrode)*

When new problems arise, don't admire them, own them. Ensure others aren't working the same issues (or working against it), but do default to taking action for the problems that you can own. See solutions to completion, or until there can be a successful (slow) transition of ownership to another unicorn.

**What does Ownership mean in Defense Unicorns?** 
- Being fully accountable for a task even if not explicitly asked

**Why is Ownership important to Defense Unicorns?**
- it is how trust is built; being accountable and always having your team’s back
- encourages inward reflection to continuously grow
- drives decentralized execution and greater efficiency
- ensures customers have a great experience and get the outcomes they were looking for
- Not only the identification of problems but taking point on solutioning.

**What is the expected behavior we are looking to drive with development of ownership habits? Said differently, what is the expected outcome?**
- Unicorns build daily habits that display ownership in their work in order to better deliver value to our customers

**How can a new hire demonstrate habits related to ownership?**
- Participation in monthly ownership meet ups in Gather
- Approximate number of Jocko emoji tags
- Customer satisfaction survey

**How has this value evolved over time within Defense Unicorns?**
- Default to action - follow up and accountability
- Evolved to ownership to bookend beginning the work

### Focused Learning

*Champions: [Mallory Grim](https://github.com/mgrim2) & [Barrett LaFrance](https://github.com/btlghrants)*

How might we encourage learning as a habit?
- Start a book club
- Recommend an article of the day
- Host tech lunches/brown bags

### Positive Thinking

*Champions: [Maggie Lyon](https://github.com/MaggieFrances) & [Eden Gebrezgi](https://github.com/edengebrezgi)*

When you feel yourself being hurt, insulted, annoyed, or pissed off follow *[Cognitive Restructuring](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_81.htm)* to shift your perspective:

### Insights

*Champions: [Andrew Greene](https://github.com/andrewsgreene) & [Anthony Wendt](https://github.com/anthonywendt)*

When you strongly believe someone is “making a mistake” let them know. Start the sentence with:
> I know our company values insights. In the spirit of making both yourself and the company better, one data point for your consideration is that I think that ______________________.

### Context 

*Champions: [Andy Roth](https://github.com/blancharda) & [Gavin Scallon](https://github.com/gscallon)* 

Context matters. No really. If someone is late to a meeting, and it's because of a family emergency, that is different then they blew it off for no good reason. Context helps others understand your perspective, which leads to developing better empathy and helps forms more effective teams.
