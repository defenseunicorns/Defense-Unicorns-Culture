## A little about Defense Unicorns.
Defense Unicorns exists to serve mission-focused heroes who recognize that outcomes aren't always directly related to the number of hours worked
They want mission success and the best way to support the mission is to make sure we take care of our people.

- **We believe that Unicorns (our employees) come first**

- **We believe that a culture first mentality is critical**

- **We believe If our company foundation is focused on culture, the technology will work itself out because we have the best people working for our company.**


>“Invest in people so they can work anywhere. Treat them in a way where they won’t want to work anywhere but here”
